  7. Set the folder to archive photos/videos successfully uploaded 
     (archiveFolder param).

RUN syno2Flickr

  Note: the first run must be in interactive mode because you need to 
        register this app with your flickr account.

  Run in interactive mode:
    #> java -jar syno2flickr.jar syno2flickr.properties

  Run in background mode for unix (need nohup installed):
    #> nohup java -jar syno2flickr.jar syno2flickr.properties >syno2flickr.log 2>&1 &


ADVANCED FEATURES

  To override a config property via command-line, use this syntax:
    #> java -jar syno2flickr.jar syno2flickr.properties <propertyName>=<value>
  Exemple:
    #> java -jar syno2flickr.jar syno2flickr.properties defaultPrivacy=1 "syncFolder=C:\\My photos"


TROUBLESHOOTING
  #1 "Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfile syno2flickr.properties":
     => add "-Dfile.encoding=UTF8" parameter for java command like this:
     #> java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -jar syno2flickr.jar syno2flickr.properties
